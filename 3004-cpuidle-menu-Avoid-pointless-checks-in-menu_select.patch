Subject: [PATCH 05/30] cpuidle: menu: Avoid pointless checks in menu_select()

If menu_select() cannot find a suitable state to return, it will
return the state index stored in data->last_state_idx.  This
means that it is pointless to look at the states whose indices
are less than or equal to data->last_state_idx in the main loop,
so don't do that.

Given that those checks are done on every idle state selection, this
change can save quite a bit of completely unnecessary overhead.
